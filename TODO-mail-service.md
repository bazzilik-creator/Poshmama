# Mail Service Implementation Plan

## Mailto Service Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### What's Been Implemented:
1. ✅ Replaced Formspree with standard mailto service
2. ✅ Updated contact form to use mailto: protocol
3. ✅ Added proper form validation and email formatting
4. ✅ Implemented success/error message display
5. ✅ Tested the mailto functionality

### How It Works:
- When users submit the form, their default email client opens
- All form data is pre-filled in the email (name, email, phone, subject, message)
- Users need to manually send the email from their email client

### Email Configuration:
- Recipient: poshmama2025@gmail.com
- No external service dependencies required
- Works with any email client (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)

### Current Status:
- ✅ Mailto service fully implemented and working
- ✅ Form validation and user feedback implemented
- ✅ No external dependencies or account setup needed
